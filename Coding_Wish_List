Wish List for Perry text project:


*** = priority for digital humanities conference (end of internship)

Midi controller (0-128)
Hopefully not more than 8 controls

Sliders/Dials
  Speed
  Size
  Alpha
  Font (include Monaco as tribute to Heavy Industries)
  Grayscale or text vs background

Button pressed (boolean, 0 or 128)
  Restart from beginning (one-time reset)
  While pressed, make text red

Toggle (true/false, switches from on to off with each press)
   *** Pause
  Reverse black and white (immediate; priority over grayscale)
    Consider possible problems of what controls font color
    If above/below [threshold], turn to opposite 
  Disrupt linearity?
    Pull random words from array
    Later: scramble words (research how in arrays... arrays within arrays. String --> chars)
      Dyslexia vs. "bad spelling version" of a text... Look at common dyslexia and spelling mistakes


Additional thoughts:
  move? (change alignement or centering? Add noise/randomness to motion?)
  React to mouse 

  *** textWidth(str) calculates and returns the width of any character or text string. Use to keep words within bounds of the frame
